# Book Library System

## Project Files
- `bookType.java` – Defines the `bookType` class, which represents a book with attributes (title, author, publisher, year published, ISBN-13, price, and number of copies).  
- `userInterface.java` – Provides the console-based user interface for interacting with the book library system. Handles menu options for searching, displaying, and updating books.  

## How to Compile
From the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `.java` files and run:

```bash
javac bookType.java userInterface.java
```

This will generate `bookType.class` and `userInterface.class`.

## How to Run
After compiling, run the program using:

```bash
java userInterface
```

The program will prompt for input as described in the assignment requirements.

## IDE Used
This project was developed and tested using **Visual Studio Code Insiders Edition**.
